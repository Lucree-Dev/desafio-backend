This POC was developed using the Python language, with DRF (Django-Rest-Framework) and JWT authentication (JSON Web Token).
It is containerized using Docker.
To install, run:
$ docker build .
$ docker-compose up

It will create admin:admin (user/pass) automatically.

Example of use:

curl \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "admin"}' \
  http://localhost:8000/api/token/
